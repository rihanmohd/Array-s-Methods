// // the arry.splice method changes an array by removing 
// // or replicing existing Elements from it , it gets a starting index a count meaning how many 
// // elements we want to remove and it can get also optionaly new elements which 
// // which will be placed inside of the array. in the end it will change the array on which 
// // is called upon and will return an array with the removed items.





// let numbers = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7];
// let deleted = numbers.splice(2, 3);
// console.log(numbers);
// console.log(deleted);




// // we can add numbers in place of the ones we are deleting ,

// let added = numbers.splice(2, 3, 100,300);
// console.log(numbers);







// // if  we dont want to remove any thing from an array but insteed we want to add in something, so we can change count property to 0.


// let numbers = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7];
// let deleted = numbers.splice(2, 0, 100,200,30);
// console.log(numbers);
// console.log(deleted);
